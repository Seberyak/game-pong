To complete the PWA functionality, you need to create two icon files:

1. images/icon-192.png - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon
2. images/icon-512.png - A 512x512 pixel PNG icon

These should be created with the following specifications:
- Format: PNG with transparency
- Content: A simple pong-related icon (paddle and ball)
- Background: Either transparent or #1a1a2e color
- Foreground: White or #4cc9f0 color

You can create these icons using any image editor or icon generator.
Once created, the game will be fully ready to be installed on mobile devices.
